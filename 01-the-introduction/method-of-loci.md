# The Method of Loci 
- This is one of the interesting way to remember somethings in the long terms.

- The technique is to create a storylines about the things you wanted to remember and connect it to dots. 

- If I want remember 5 playing cards with different shapes and number in the shuffles card pile.

- I can first pick up a location whatever I want and make one of the card have meaning on it.

- Example, the card with the 7 of Diamonds, I can imagine that I wake up from morning and see 7 of diamonds ring around me.  

- This is to make something really ridiculous in my head, and from there our brain can easily remember those ridiculous thing for now 

- To make this efficient enough, may need to keep doing this for a week so that our brain have train to remember things with that method
