# The Principles

## Learning VS Winning The System
- Learning is to do long term learning instead of learn how to win on the system.
- Learning is to retain the information longer instead of learn how to ace on something in the system.
- To expand this topic, please go ahead and read this [The Lesson to Unlearn](http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html)

## What is Success?
- Drive and Persistence can actually lead to success.
- Need to work hard for what you want. 

## The Obstacle
- No matter what, when we learn any topic, we are going to encounter this obstacle that you suck.
- Might need shift this focus of obstacles to something "Good, I'm doing something worthwhile", "I'm learning a skill that probably others are feeling the same thing, they're going to turn around, but that's not me"

## The Dip
- Need to know what is the dip is and stop the learning path and start another new path.
- This is to know not everyone are good on something like programmers, athlete, or other role, we need choose the smart path instead of keep trying the obstacle.
- Need to know when to stop, to turn around and do something different as it is to push to go over the obstacle.
- Sometimes we have to know when to turn around and pick the right path in order to use our resources efficiently.
