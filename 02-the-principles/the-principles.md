# The Principles

## Learning VS Winning The System
- Learning is to do long term learning instead of learn how to win on the system.
- Learning is to retain the information longer instead of learn how to ace on something in the system.
- To expand this topic, please go ahead and read this [The Lesson to Unlearn](http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html)

## What is Success?
- Drive and Persistence can actually lead to success.
- Need to work hard for what you want. 

## The Obstacle
- No matter what, when we learn any topic, we are going to encounter this obstacle that you suck.
- Might need shift this focus of obstacles to something "Good, I'm doing something worthwhile", "I'm learning a skill that probably others are feeling the same thing, they're going to turn around, but that's not me"

## The Dip
- Need to know what is the dip is and stop the learning path and start another new path.
- This is to know not everyone are good on something like programmers, athlete, or other role, we need choose the smart path instead of keep trying the obstacle.
- Need to know when to stop, to turn around and do something different as it is to push to go over the obstacle.
- Sometimes we have to know when to turn around and pick the right path in order to use our resources efficiently.

## Compound Learning 
- This concept is came from compound interest, if you put $100 in to a bank account with interest rate 3% a month, after 60 years your bank account will have $600 where included those interest rate.
- Is to break down the full course of 12 hours to learn in a day to learn it 20 minutes a day consistently.
- Quotes from Alan Weiss, Ph.D. - `Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you're twice as good.`

## Failure Don't Count
- Everyone will have failure in somethings but with these failure it will become your grain of experience of that things.
- No need to be successfully all the times but can make some mistake on it, those mistake won't count to against you.
- Every time you fail, there will have some feedback on the topic you fail and use that feedback to do it better next time.

## Choice VS Chore
- Need to shift our thinking that learning isn't a chore but is a choice, because choice are temporary and it won't last long.
- If you keep thinking that learning is a chore for everyday, in long term you will struggle that learning is on of your chore to do.
- Think that learning is a choice, like we have choice to rest today and not doing anything.

## It's All In The Frame
- Nothing in the world is objectives.
- Frame is what human change the perspectives.
- The principle ideal is to reframe the learning is when hit some obstacle or frustrated on it, shift to I'm growing, I have choice to learn, I just haven't there yet.
- The principle are meant to shift your focus, shift your perspectives into what you can control instead of what we have no control over.

## Pareto Principle
- Knows as 80/20 rules, idea of law of vital few.
- Is it 80% of result are effected by 20% of inputs or causes.
- Is not necessary 20% that give us the 80% of result, but is eliminating things from 100% to 20%.
- Think of is that necessary to use all the time to master one topic instead of focus the 20% of core of the topic.

## Skill Stacking 
- Which this are the curiosity and value of the learning.
- This is to gathering skills and combining skills in unique ways.
- Gathering multiple skills and combine it in your unique ways is the most valuable learning skill.
- This have skills that could work well when combining it together.

## Happiness Factors
- Emotional will affect when learning, happiness will be one of the factor to learn some topics.
- Look at our daily life, what is the key that always make you happy, and use that as your motivation to learning.

## Your Productivity Time
- Some people is morning person and their most productivity time is morning, some is nighthawks where their productivity time is night time.
- So need to find your own productivity time for learning.

## Self Learning Diagram
- This is need to know what path you have chosen to be the learner.
- You need to have the intrinsic motivation to learning some topics.

## Section Review
- This principle is to shift our perspective and concept of learning.
- When we are not happy to learn, struggle, or doesn't have the motive to learning, we have refer back all this principle too.
